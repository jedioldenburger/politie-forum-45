## Key Findings Summary

### Technical Status
- ✅ robots.txt: Accessible, properly configured
- ✅ Homepage: Fully crawlable, complete HTML
- ✅ Metadata: All tags present and optimized
- ✅ Structured data: Valid JSON-LD
- ⚠️ Indexation: Unknown (needs GSC verification)

### Root Causes
1. **Hidden Indexation Barrier**: GSC not verified (unknown status)
2. **Algorithmic Suppression**: New YMYL domain in Sandbox (6-12 months)
3. **Authority Gap**: 40-60 DA point disadvantage vs. competitors
4. **E-E-A-T Crisis**: Anonymous forum on sensitive topic = inherently distrusted
5. **Brand Name Trap**: "politie forum" = ambiguous search intent

### Recovery Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Days 1-7): Technical verification + trust pages
- **Phase 2** (Months 1-6): Content creation + brand building
- **Phase 3** (Months 6-18): Authority building + backlink acquisition
- **Expected Result**: Top 10 ranking for "politie forum" within 18-24 months

## FAQ

### Q: Why isn't the site ranking?
A: Three compounding reasons: (1) Hidden indexation issue (needs GSC verification), (2) Sandbox algorithm (new YMYL domain probation), (3) Zero authority signals (no backlinks, brand recognition).

### Q: How long will this take?
A: 12-24 months minimum. The Sandbox alone adds 6-9 months of suppression regardless of fixes.

### Q: Can we speed this up?
A: Not significantly. The Sandbox is a protective algorithm that cannot be bypassed. However, consistent execution of the recovery plan will ensure graduation happens on schedule.

### Q: Is the site broken?
A: No. The site is technically sound. The problem is algorithmic suppression and authority deficit, not technical defects.

### Q: Do we need to rebuild the site?
A: No. The technical foundation is solid. Focus on content, backlinks, and brand-building instead.

### Q: What if we do nothing?
A: The site will remain invisible indefinitely. Without authority signals, the Sandbox will hold the site indefinitely.
